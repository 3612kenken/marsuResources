           "history":   "The College of Information and Computing Sciences is one of the premier colleges in the province for IT
                        Education and services. It aims to produce competitive IT professionals and IT-enabled individuals who
                        will encourage real innovation for the advancement in the digital era of the province and the country as a
                        whole. \n 
                        The college was established in 1998 at MSC Boac Campus through BOT Resolution No. 35, s. 1998 as
                        Institute of Information and Computing Sciences (IICS), a special program to offer Associate in Computer
                        Technology (ACT). Believing that the province needs IT Human Resources, after two years, IICS was
                        adopted as the School of Information and Computing Sciences (SICS), offering two emerging degree
                        programs Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Bachelor of Science in Information
                        Technology to cater to the graduates of ACT. Bachelor of Science in Information Management was also
                        offered in Sta. Cruz Campus. The Bachelor of Science in Information Management (BSIM) was renamed to
                        the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) to adapt to CHED Memorandum Order No. 53 series
                        of 2006.  \n 
                        After a decade, the Marinduque State College had an organizational restructuring wherein two of the big
                        schools in the college were merged. The School of Industrial Technology and the School of Information
                        and Computing Sciences convergence paved the way for the School of Technology's birth in 2016. After
                        three years of being together, the two schools parted ways due to another organizational restructuring
                        and SICS was re-birth in 2019.  \n 
                        In 2021, however, SICS was converted to the Institute of Information Systems and Technology (IIST) and
                        became part of the College of Engineering, Information and Industrial Technology (CEIIT) together with
                        the Institute of Engineering and Department of Industrial Technology to centralize the resources of these
                        three into a single college. But once again, fate has plans for this institute and let it navigate its ship on its
                        own. Finally, the former school was converted into a college, banning the name of the College of
                        Information and Computing Sciences (CICS).  \n 
                        In 25 years of its existence, CICS has contributed significantly to MSC's mandates in Instruction, Research,
                        Extension, and Production. Currently, both the BS in Information Systems and BS in Information
                        Technology in Boac Campus are Level III Re-Accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges
                        and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), while the BS in Information Systems in Sta. Cruz Campus is
                        Level II Re-Accredited. CICS has produced thousands of IT professionals serving in the province, other parts
                        of the country, and even the global industry. Faculty and students are also actively engaged in research
                        through various local and international presentations and publications. CICS also serves the community
                        by providing relevant extension projects and activities.  \n 
                        For the years to come, CICS still commits to giving what their stakeholders deserve through quality
                        education and public service with their mantra, `WORK IN SILENCE AND LET OUR SUCCESS MAKE OUR
                        NOISE!`

           "history":   "The College of Education at Marinduque State University has a rich history, with the university
                        beginning as the Marinduque School of Arts and Trades (MSAT) in 1952, offering vocational and
                        technical programs. It evolved significantly over the years, introducing the Bachelor of Science in
                        Industrial Education (BSIE) in 1976 under the Professional Industrial Education Department (PIED),
                        which laid the foundation for the School of Education. Through legislative actions, the institution
                        transformed into the Marinduque Institute of Science and Technology (MSIT) in 1983 and later
                        Marinduque State College (MSC) in 1992, expanding its programs. /n
                        The BSIE curriculum was enhanced into the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) with
                        specializations in Industrial Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science, further solidifying the
                        institution's role in producing competent educators. In 1992, the integration of Marinduque Community
                        College (MCC) in Sta. Cruz into MSC expanded the School of Education’s reach, incorporating the
                        Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd). /n
                        The college continued to refine its offerings, introducing Music, Arts, Physical Education, and Health
                        (MAPHE) in 2006-2007 and launching the Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Music
                        Education in 2009. With evolving educational reforms, the College of Education aligned its curriculum
                        with CHED guidelines, offering BSEd programs with specialization in Mathematics, Science, and
                        Social Studies; Bachelor of Culture and Arts Education, and Bachelor of Technology and Livelihood
                        Education by 2018-2019. /n
                        The BEEd program remains housed in the Sta. Cruz branch, emphasizing the institution’s commitment
                        to quality teacher education and academic excellence.
